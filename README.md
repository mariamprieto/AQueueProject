This project consists of a generic queue implementation using a fixed-size array (circular buffer) in C#. It includes:

        •	Basic queue operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, and Contains.
        
        •	Automated unit tests: Covering basic functionality, edge cases (such as empty and full queue scenarios), and circular wrap-around behavior.
        
        •       Performance measurement: Using Stopwatch to analyze actual operation times and confirm expected time complexities.
        
        •	Theoretical complexity verification: Ensuring that Enqueue, Dequeue, and Peek perform in O(1), and Contains in O(n).
